                    <p className="about-three__text">
                      As a business owner, flexibility is essential. At Elite Funders, we understand that growth doesn’t always happen on a predictable schedule—and neither should your financing. With our Revenue-Based Financing solution, you’ll receive the capital you need while enjoying the freedom to pay based on the revenue you generate. This model is perfect for fast-growing businesses, providing a flexible alternative to traditional loans, with terms that scale alongside your sales performance.
                    </p>

                    <h3 className="about-three__sub-title">Why Choose Revenue-Based Financing from Elite Funders?</h3>
                    <p className="about-three__text">
                      Unlike fixed-term loans, Revenue-Based Financing from Elite Funders is designed to grow with your business, offering a model where repayments are based on a percentage of monthly revenue. As your business thrives and sales increase, repayments adjust proportionately, ensuring you never overextend during periods of lower revenue.
                    </p>
                    <p className="about-three__text">
                      At Elite Funders, our goal is to support businesses by making financing accessible, adaptable, and responsive to your unique cash flow patterns. This model is particularly advantageous for businesses with consistent sales but who want to avoid the burden of fixed monthly payments that can strain operations during slower periods.
